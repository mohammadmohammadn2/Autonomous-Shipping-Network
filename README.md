# Decentralized Autonomous Shipping Network (ShippingDAO)

A blockchain-based platform coordinating autonomous vessels, cargo tracking, route optimization, and port operations through smart contracts and decentralized governance.

## Overview

ShippingDAO revolutionizes maritime logistics by creating a decentralized network of autonomous ships, smart ports, and cargo tracking systems. The platform enables efficient coordination of shipping operations while ensuring transparency, security, and optimal resource utilization.

## Core Components

### Vessel Registration Contract

The Vessel Registration Contract manages autonomous ship identities:

- Vessel identity verification
- Certification management
- Technical specification tracking
- Maintenance history
- Insurance status verification
- Crew requirements tracking
- Safety compliance monitoring
- Emergency protocol management

### Cargo Contract

The Cargo Contract handles shipment logistics:

- Cargo manifests management
- Real-time tracking
- Smart container integration
- Customs documentation
- Hazardous materials tracking
- Temperature monitoring
- Chain of custody
- Insurance coverage tracking

### Route Optimization Contract

The Route Optimization Contract determines efficient paths:

- Weather data integration
- Fuel efficiency calculation
- Port congestion analysis
- Piracy risk assessment
- Environmental impact tracking
- Speed optimization
- Alternative route planning
- Emergency rerouting

### Port Management Contract

The Port Management Contract coordinates port operations:

- Berth allocation
- Loading/unloading scheduling
- Resource assignment
- Customs clearance
- Port fee management
- Equipment coordination
- Storage management
- Maintenance scheduling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum wallet with sufficient ETH
- Maritime IoT integration capability
- Node.js v16.0.0 or higher
- Solidity ^0.8.0
- AIS transponder integration
- Weather data feed access

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/shipping-dao.git
cd shipping-dao
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

4. Deploy contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat deploy --network <your-network>
```

## Usage

### Registering a Vessel

```javascript
const vesselRegistration = await VesselRegistrationContract.deploy();
await vesselRegistration.registerVessel(
    vesselSpecifications,
    certifications,
    safetyProtocols,
    autonomyLevel
);
```

### Creating a Cargo Shipment

```javascript
const cargoContract = await CargoContract.deploy();
await cargoContract.createShipment(
    cargoDetails,
    originPort,
    destinationPort,
    requirements
);
```

### Optimizing Routes

```javascript
const routeOptimization = await RouteOptimizationContract.deploy();
await routeOptimization.calculateRoute(
    vesselId,
    startPoint,
    endPoint,
    constraints
);
```
